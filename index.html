    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      With many people graduating, something they may be thinking about is where they would like to move post-graduation. With so many options of where to live, the rising popularity of remote work and the vast number of resources around city quality of life, making this choice can be overwhelming for many. Therefore our area of interest is to identify cities around the world and what it is like to live there. Our project aims to make these choices easier through location-related visualizations.
