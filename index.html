    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      With many people graduating, something they may be thinking about is where they would like to move post-graduation. With so many options of where to live, the rising popularity of remote work and the vast number of resources around city quality of life, making this choice can be overwhelming for many. Therefore our area of interest is to identify cities around the world and what it is like to live there. Our project aims to make these choices easier through location-related visualizations.

  <h1>Demo Video</h1>
  
  <p>
    Embed an MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, below is a screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3. <strong>Be sure to delete this filler text before your final submission!</strong>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    Replace with an explanation of your visualization and linked presentation slides. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Venture Capital
    There are three linked visualizations that make up our visualization tool:
    1. A heat map that displays the average overall score for each continent.
    2. A bar chart that displays the Macroeconomic, Recreational, Residential, and Environmental Quality category scores for the chosen continent.
    (* Please look below to see a breakdown of what was considered in each category's measure)
    3. A scatterplot that displays the average overall score for a city against the chosen category. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The three visuals are linked in the following way:
    1. When one clicks on the continent of choice, the bar chart updates with the category score for the continent.
    2. When one click on a bar in the bar graph, the scatterplot updates with the the city level data for the category.
    </li>
    <li>
    For readability, we have added the collowing features:
    1. A legend on the heat map so that one can better understand the continents' corresponding coloring, please note that a darket color corresponds to a higher score.
    2. Color coded bar graph, meaning that when one clicks on a bar in the bar graph, the points in the scatterplot display the same color as the chosen bar.
    3. A tool tip so that when one hovers over a given point in the scatterplot, the city's name, average overall score, and category score show up.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    * There are four categories shown in the visualizations above. Each categories is an average of many related attributes. Below you will see what each category is compromised of.
